# Tasks: {SESSION_ID}

**Session**: {session-id}
**Type**: {github_issue|unstructured}
**Goal**: {goal or issue title}
**Generated**: {timestamp}

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 [P] Configure dependencies and tooling
- [ ] T003 [P] Setup development environment

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema (if applicable)
- [ ] T005 [P] Configure authentication/authorization (if applicable)
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities
- [ ] T008 [P] Configure error handling and logging

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (if TDD requested)

- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] [TEST] Contract test for {endpoint}
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] [TEST] Integration test for {user journey}

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create {Entity1} model in src/models/{entity1}.py
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create {Entity2} model in src/models/{entity2}.py
- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement {Service} in src/services/{service}.py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add API endpoint in src/api/{endpoint}.py
- [ ] T015 [US1] [MANUAL] Browser test: verify {feature} works

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 fully functional and testable

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description]

**Independent Test**: [Verification criteria]

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T016 [P] [US2] Create {Entity} model
- [ ] T017 [US2] Implement {Service}
- [ ] T018 [US2] Add {endpoint/feature}
- [ ] T019 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 both work independently

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] [DOC] Update documentation
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX [TEST] Additional test coverage
- [ ] TXXX Run full test suite and verify

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3+ (User Stories)**: All depend on Foundational completion
- **Phase N (Polish)**: Depends on all desired user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - no dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - may integrate with US1
- User stories are designed to be independently testable

### Parallel Opportunities

Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within the same phase:

```
# Phase 2 parallel group:
T005, T006, T008 (all [P], different files)

# US1 parallel group:
T011, T012 (model creation, no dependencies)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Recommended)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 → **MVP checkpoint**
4. Add remaining stories incrementally

### Single Developer Flow

```
Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → Polish
                        ↓
                   MVP Checkpoint
```

## Task Format Reference

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[P]` | Parallelizable - no dependencies on incomplete tasks |
| `[USn]` | Belongs to User Story n |
| `[TEST]` | Test task - write test first (TDD) |
| `[MANUAL]` | Manual verification required |
| `[DOC]` | Documentation task |
| `[SKIP]` | Obsolete - document reason |

---

## Notes

- Follow TDD: test → implement → verify
- Complete one task fully before moving to next
- Mark [x] as you complete each task
- Commit after each task with task ID: `feat: add X (T014)`
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
